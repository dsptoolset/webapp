# Cube web app
An interactive digital signal processing (DSP) application for designing filters, estimating power spectral density, generating waveforms, and more.

## Filter Design
The application supports designing digital filters using several methods:

- Visually placing poles and zeros on the Z-plane
- Windowing methods for FIR filter design
- Analog-to-digital IIR filter design using Butterworth and Chebyshev filters
- Weighted least-squares design of linear-phase FIR filters

After a filter is designed, the application:

- Computes and displays the magnitude and phase of the frequency response
- Generates the corresponding filter coefficients
- Simulates and visualizes the filter’s output on user-selected input signals

## Spectral Estimation

For spectrum estimation, the app can receive:

- a signal from a file, or
- an expressions to generate signals directly.

Afterwards, the app estimates power spectrum desnsity (PSD) via periodogram or Welch's method.


## Getting Started
To use the app, simply visit [AvaDSP.github.io/webapp](https://AvaDSP.github.io/webapp).
Alternatively, to install and run the app locally, make sure you have a recent version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
Afterwards:

- Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:AvaDSP/webapp.git
cd webapp
```
- Install the dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```
- Run the web app:
```shell
npm run dev
```
- The app should become accessible on 'http://localhost:3000' or on a similar port.
